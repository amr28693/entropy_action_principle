# CE Action Principle: Unifying Entropy, Quantum, and Spacetime via Collapse-Emergence

# For preprint and supplementary materials, see [arxiv_CE_action_preprint_DRAFT1.pdf](arxiv_CE_action_preprint_DRAFT1.pdf)


# Overview

CE Action Principle is a unified framework synthesizing thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and spacetime geometry from a new 
information-theoretic action based on entropy-driven collapse events. 

This project includes all core code and numerical experiments supporting the preprint:

> Action Principle for Entropy: A Synthesis Generating Thermodynamics, Quantum Structures, and Spacetime Geometry from a Delta-Supported Collapse Surface

This repository provides full, reproducible Jupyter walkthroughs for all published figures and results.

To reproduce the results and figures of the associated preprint, simply run the scripts in order. They are labelled in a manner corresponding
with their respective sections in the Appendices.
